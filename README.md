## 📖 Introduction

This project introduces an innovative approach to enhance QA systems in financial reasoning tasks through the integration of a reflection module and error log. We apply this method to a Financial Math Reasoning dataset, which features multimodal reasoning challenges. Our system retrieves past errors, provides corrective feedback, and stores mistakes for long-term improvement. The experiments show significant gains in reasoning accuracy, particularly when dealing with complex financial questions.

**Figure**: *Illustrating a multimodal reasoning framework for answering questions step-by-step with iterative feedback. 
The system takes multimodal inputs (text and images) and generates reasoning steps along with an answer inference. 
If the output is correct, the reasoning and answer are accepted. If incorrect, the process involves rationale step 
correction via manual annotation and error analysis. Feedback generation introduces negative examples and AI feedback to 
improve reasoning. The improved insights are used for in-context learning, enhancing the reasoning steps and answer inference. 
This approach emphasizes iterative improvement and error correction for better accuracy.*

## 🏆 Leaderboard

The leaderboard is available [here](https://mathllm.github.io/mathvision/#leaderboard).

## :wrench: Installation
Our implementation is based on PyTorch and HuggingFace (transformers + datasets). 

Requirements:
* Python 3.8.5
* Pytorch 1.10.0
* transformers 4.20.0
* datasets 2.3.2
* tqdm, sklearn, numpy, pandas

Step-by-step instructions to get you code and environment:
### 1) Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/biggestCjb/FinMR.git    
```

A folder called ```FinMR``` with all the codebase should appear.

### 2) Install the required packages:

Make sure that you have Anaconda installed. If not - follow this [miniconda installation](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

To run Progressive Prompts code on GPU, make sure that you have a CUDA capable GPU and the [drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) for your GPU are up to date. In our implementation, we used and CUDA 12.1.

You can re-create our conda enviroment from ```environment.yaml``` file:

```bash
cd FinMR
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

Your conda should start downloading and extracting packages.

### 3) Activate the environment:

Your environment should be called ```FinMR```, and you can activate it now to run the scripts:

```bash
conda activate FinMR
```
### 4) Get model weight:
Download the weights of the model from the link below

## 📈 How to Evaluation

### Generating Outputs of Different Models

#### Claude

```bash
cd ask_LLM/Multimodal/models
python Claude_3.5.py
```

This will run the Claude API and save the outputs to `outputs/Multimodal/claude` path. 

#### GPT

```bash
cd ask_LLM/Multimodal/models
python GPT_4o.py
```
This will run the GPT API and save the outputs to `outputs/Multimodal/gpt` path. 

### Evaluation of Model Outputs

Once all the model outputs have been generated, execute the `evaluation/evaluate.ipynb` function to assess these outputs. This will examine all outputs located in the `outputs/` directory, computing overall accuracy as well as accuracy for each subject and level.
